# FarmGuard


### Problem Statement : Knowledge representation and insight generation from structured datasets.





### Objectives


>To implement precision agriculture, modern farming technique that uses research data of soil characteristics, soil types, crop yield data collection and suggests the farmers the right crop based on their site specific parameters to reduce the wrong choice on a crop and increase in productivity.

>To solve the problem by proposing a recommendation system through an ensemble model with majority voting technique crop for the site specific parameters with high accuracy and efficiency.

>To recommend fertilizer on the basis of N, P, K values and crop.

>To detect the disease.

### Unique Idea 

##### Precision Crop Recommendation: 
FarmGuard uses sophisticated algorithms to analyze various data points such as soil quality, climate conditions, and historical crop performance. This analysis enables it to recommend the most suitable crops for a particular farm, optimizing yields and promoting sustainable farming practices.

##### Optimized Fertilizer Management: 
By leveraging real-time data and advanced analytics, FarmGuard recommends precise types and quantities of fertilizers based on the specific nutrient needs of the soil. This approach minimizes over-application, reduces costs, and decreases environmental impact, while still maximizing crop productivity.

##### Early Disease Detection and Management:
Using AI-driven image recognition and sensor data, FarmGuard can identify potential diseases and pest infestations early. This early detection allows farmers to take timely action, reducing crop losses and minimizing the use of pesticides

### Conclusion

India’s farmers are hard at work. They help to feed a nation whose population is nearly 1.4 billion. However their productivity is threatened by some natural factors that can ruin their crops and their livelihoods. So, the solution will benefit farmers to maximize productivity in agriculture, reduce soil degradation in cultivated fields, and have informed advice on organic fertilizers/ other fertilizers and also know about the right crop by considering various attributes. This would provide a comprehensive prediction and hence benefit both farmers and environment.
